# Google-Reimagined
A Custom SERP For Google Chrome
This theme was built to create a more comfortable and focused browsing experience on Google. It's more than just a color swap; it's a structural and aesthetic overhaul.

True Dark Mode: Uses a deep charcoal and grey palette (#121214, #1a1a1e) that's easy on the eyes, avoiding pure black.

Centered, Single-Column Layout: The entire page content, from the search bar to the footer, is centered in the browser window for improved focus and readability on wider screens. The right-hand sidebar is removed.

Card-Based Design: Each search result, AI Overview, and "People also ask" section is styled as a distinct "card" with rounded corners, subtle borders, and a soft box-shadow.

Clean & Consistent UI:

Restyles all major SERP components, including the Dictionary, Translate, and Knowledge Panel widgets.

Custom styling for buttons, links, and the footer to match the theme.

Softened Visuals: Images are toned down slightly with a CSS filter to reduce brightness and prevent them from jarring against the dark background.

Easily Customizable: The entire color scheme is controlled by CSS variables in the :root section, making it simple to tweak colors without digging through the code.
